                                <p>Because the system is designed so that there are diminishing returns as a stake pool
                                    approaches a certain percentage of the total network stake. This promotes
                                    decentralization and a competitive stake pool market by incentivizing stakeholders
                                    to switch stake pools when their current pool gets too big - so ensuring that the
                                    rates that stake pools charge stay competitive as they try and attract new
                                    stakeholders. To enable stakeholders to make the best decisions about where to
                                    delegate their stake, a pool-sorting machanism will be available.</p>

                                    selected to create the next block - and when you create a block you get rewards.
                                    Stake pools are run by other users on the network, with the promise of being online
                                    all the time to maximize the chances of a stake pool member being chosen as slot
                                    leader. If someone in the stake pool is chosen to create the next block, then
                                    everyone in the pool shares the reward, and the stake pool owner will get their
                                    margin as a bonus reward for running the stake pool and supporting the network.</p>

                                <p>For maximal efficiency and security, a solid majority of stake (about 80%) should be
                                    delegated to a number of stake pools (about 100 seems to be a reasonable number).

                                    The stake pools should be online when needed, and they should provide relay nodes,
                                    which are additional network infrastructure. The remaining proportion of stake
                                    (about 20%) should belong to “small” stakeholders, who can decide to either
                                    participate in the protocol on their own or to simply do nothing.</p>

                                <h6>DELEGATION CERTIFICATES</h6>
                                <div class="space-20"></div>
                                <p>A delegation certificate delegates staking rights from one staking key to another.

                                    It can be published on the blockchain as part of the metadata of a transaction, in
                                    which case a pointer addresses can refer to it. Such a published certificate is
                                    called heavyweight. In case of conflicting certificates, later in the blockchain
                                    wins.

                                    The fees for creating a heavyweight delegation certificate are the transaction fees
                                    for the containing transaction.

                                    A lightweight certificate is not published on the blockchain, but instead included
                                    in block headers to prove staking rights for the address that was elected slot
                                    leader. It also contains a “serial number” to break ties.</p>

                                <p>Cardano is a proof of stake system, so holding stake, i.e. owning Ada, means more
                                    than holding Bitcoin means for the Bitcoin protocol.

                                    Cardano is a fully-fledged cryptocurrency, so of course Ada can be used to buy goods
                                    or services. In addition to that, holding Ada also comes with the right and
                                    obligation to participate in the protocol and to create blocks.

                                    These two aspects of holding Ada can be separated by means of delegation: a
                                    stakeholder can delegate her right to protocol participation while retaining the
                                    monetary value.</p>

                                    it in a transaction that pays the pool registration fees to a special address.

                                    The certificate contains the staking key of the pool leader.

                                    People wishing to delegate to the pool must create (heavyweight) delegation
                                    certificates delegating their stake to that key.</p>

                                    identically as far as payment is concerned.

                                    Base address: The staking key is directly linked to the address.
                                    Pointer address: The address contains a “pointer” to a delegation certificate on the
                                    blockchain which defines the staking key.
                                    Enterprise address: Staking is not possible. This address type is meant for
                                    exchanges, who are not supposed to use funds entrusted to them for protocol

                                    The prevention of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In a DDoS attack, an
                                    attacker tries to flood the network with spam transactions. If he was required to
                                    pay a sufficiently high fee for each of those dummy transactions, this form of
                                    attack would become prohibitively expensive.
                                    To provide funds for incentives.</p>

                                    The minimal fees for a transaction are calculated according to the formula:

                                    a + b × size

                                    where:

                                    a is a special constant, at the moment it is 0.155381 ADA;
                                    b is a special constant, at the moment it is 0.000043946
                                    ADA/byte;

                                    size is the size of the transaction in bytes.
                                    The reason for having parameter a is the prevention of DDoS attacks mentioned above.
                                    Even a very small dummy transaction should cost enough to hurt an attacker who tries
                                    to generate many thousands of them.

                                    Parameter b has been introduced to reflect actual costs: storing larger transactions
                                    needs more computer memory than storing smaller transactions, so larger transactions
                                    should be more expensive than smaller ones.

                                    Although particular values for parameters a and b were calculated, these values will
                                    probably be adjusted in future to better reflect actual costs.</p>

                                <p>In the operation of Ouroboros, the proof of stake protocol running Cardano, time is
                                    divided into epochs and slots. A slot lasts 20 seconds, while an epoch contains
                                    21,600 slots and lasts five days.

                                    Incentives are distributed each epoch. Transaction fees of the blocks created during
                                    that epoch (together with Ada from monetary expansion) are collected into a virtual
                                    rewards pool and that total is distributed amongst the stakeholders.</p>

                                <h6>BASIC IDEA OF DISTRIBUTION</h6>
                                <div class="space-20"></div>
                                <p>The rewards pool from one epoch is distributed amongst stake pools (and individual
                                    protocol participants) according to their stake.

                                    There are two conceivable ways of doing this:

                                    Proportional to stake controlled at the beginning of that epoch.
                                    Proportional to the number of slots the stake pool was elected slot leader (not to
                                    the number of blocks created).</p>

                                <p>Note that the two refinements explained before can lead to a situation where not all
                                    funds contained in the rewards pool will be distributed. This is a feature that
                                    allows the remaining funds to be put to use in the treasury.</p>

                                <p>The way the distribution of funds works means that there is no competition between
                                    pools: There is nothing one pool can do to increase its rewards by decreasing
                                    another pool’s rewards.

                                    Note also that the way distribution of funds works implies that there is no
                                    competition between pools: There is nothing one pool can do to increase its rewards
                                    by decreasing another pool’s rewards.

                                    Neither is there any incentive for any pool to sabotage another pool’s work.</p>

                        <p>“Key to decentralisation is the ability of stakeholders to delegate stake. In a proof of
                            stake system such as Cardano, stakeholders have an obligation to take part in the protocol.
                            To make this practical, stakeholders are able to delegate their obligations to others —
                            so-called stake pools — which are able to fulfill the obligations. Stake pools operate core
                            nodes that are online at all times and take part in the protocol and produce blocks in the
                            blockchain.”
