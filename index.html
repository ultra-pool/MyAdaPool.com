                                    <p>For maximal efficiency and security, a solid majority of stake (about 80%) should be delegated to a number of stake pools (about 100 seems to be a reasonable number).

                                        The stake pools should be online when needed, and they should provide relay nodes, which are additional network infrastructure. The remaining proportion of stake (about 20%) should belong to “small” stakeholders, who can decide to either participate in the protocol on their own or to simply do nothing.</p>
                                    <div class="space-20"></div>

                                    <div class="space-20"></div>
                                    <p>A delegation certificate delegates staking rights from one staking key to another.

                                        It can be published on the blockchain as part of the metadata of a transaction, in which case a pointer addresses can refer to it. Such a published certificate is called heavyweight. In case of conflicting certificates, later in the blockchain wins.
                                        
                                        The fees for creating a heavyweight delegation certificate are the transaction fees for the containing transaction.
                                        
                                        A lightweight certificate is not published on the blockchain, but instead included in block headers to prove staking rights for the address that was elected slot leader. It also contains a “serial number” to break ties.</p>

                                    <p>Cardano is a proof of stake system, so holding stake, i.e. owning Ada, means more than holding Bitcoin means for the Bitcoin protocol.

                                        Cardano is a fully-fledged cryptocurrency, so of course Ada can be used to buy goods or services. In addition to that, holding Ada also comes with the right and obligation to participate in the protocol and to create blocks.
                                        
                                        These two aspects of holding Ada can be separated by means of delegation: a stakeholder can delegate her right to protocol participation while retaining the monetary value.</p>

                                    <p>Somebody wanting to create a stake pool creates a registration certificate and embeds it in a transaction that pays the pool registration fees to a special address.

                                        The certificate contains the staking key of the pool leader.
                                        
                                        People wishing to delegate to the pool must create (heavyweight) delegation certificates delegating their stake to that key.</p>

                                        Base address: The staking key is directly linked to the address.
                                        Pointer address: The address contains a “pointer” to a delegation certificate on the blockchain which defines the staking key.
                                        Enterprise address: Staking is not possible. This address type is meant for exchanges, who are not supposed to use funds entrusted to them for protocol participation.</p>

                                    <div class="space-20"></div>
                                    <p>There are two main reasons for having transaction fees in Cardano, or any other cryptocurrency:

                                        The prevention of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In a DDoS attack, an attacker tries to flood the network with spam transactions. If he was required to pay a sufficiently high fee for each of those dummy transactions, this form of attack would become prohibitively expensive.
                                        To provide funds for incentives.</p>
                                    <div class="space-20"></div>
                                </div>
                                <div class="single-faq">
                                    <h6>MINIMAL FEES</h6>
                                    <div class="space-20"></div>
                                    <p>For example, a transaction of size 200 bytes (a fairly typical size) costs:

                                        0.155381 ADA + 0.000043946 ADA/byte × 200 byte = 0.1641702 ADA.
                                        
                                        The minimal fees for a transaction are calculated according to the formula:
                                        
                                        a + b × size
                                        
                                        where:
                                        
                                        a is a special constant, at the moment it is 0.155381 ADA;
                                        b is a special constant, at the moment it is 0.000043946
                                        ADA/byte;
                                        
                                        size is the size of the transaction in bytes.
                                        The reason for having parameter a is the prevention of DDoS attacks mentioned above. Even a very small dummy transaction should cost enough to hurt an attacker who tries to generate many thousands of them.
                                        
                                        Parameter b has been introduced to reflect actual costs: storing larger transactions needs more computer memory than storing smaller transactions, so larger transactions should be more expensive than smaller ones.
                                        
                                        Although particular values for parameters a and b were calculated, these values will probably be adjusted in future to better reflect actual costs.</p>

                                    <p>In the operation of Ouroboros, the proof of stake protocol running Cardano, time is divided into epochs and slots. A slot lasts 20 seconds, while an epoch contains 21,600 slots and lasts five days.

                                        Incentives are distributed each epoch. Transaction fees of the blocks created during that epoch (together with Ada from monetary expansion) are collected into a virtual rewards pool and that total is distributed amongst the stakeholders.</p>

                                    <p>The rewards pool from one epoch is distributed amongst stake pools (and individual protocol participants) according to their stake.

                                        There are two conceivable ways of doing this:
                                        
                                        Proportional to stake controlled at the beginning of that epoch.
                                        Proportional to the number of slots the stake pool was elected slot leader (not to the number of blocks created).</p>

                                    <p>Note that the two refinements explained before can lead to a situation where not all funds contained in the rewards pool will be distributed. This is a feature that allows the remaining funds to be put to use in the treasury.</p>

                                    <p>The way the distribution of funds works means that there is no competition between pools: There is nothing one pool can do to increase its rewards by decreasing another pool’s rewards.

                                        Note also that the way distribution of funds works implies that there is no competition between pools: There is nothing one pool can do to increase its rewards by decreasing another pool’s rewards.
                                        
                                        Neither is there any incentive for any pool to sabotage another pool’s work.</p>

                        <p>“Key to decentralisation is the ability of stakeholders to delegate stake. In a proof of stake system such as Cardano, stakeholders have an obligation to take part in the protocol. To make this practical, stakeholders are able to delegate their obligations to others — so-called stake pools — which are able to fulfill the obligations. Stake pools operate core nodes that are online at all times and take part in the protocol and produce blocks in the blockchain.”
